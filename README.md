## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the backend of the BadBank application on your local development environment.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Database system (e.g., MongoDB)](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jredman92/badbank-server.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd badbank-server

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

4. Configure your MongoDB connection:

    In your project directory, create a .env file if it doesn't exist already. This file will store your MongoDB connection details. Replace the placeholders with your MongoDB credentials:
    
    ```bash
    MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```  

   The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

## Setting Up MongoDB Credentials
To set up your MongoDB credentials, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account or use your existing MongoDB server.

2. Create a new MongoDB cluster or use an existing one.

3. In your MongoDB cluster, click on "Connect" and choose "Connect your application."

4. Copy the connection string provided and replace the `your-mongodb-uri` placeholder in your `.env` file with this connection string.

By following these steps, you will have your own MongoDB credentials configured for the BadBank server.
